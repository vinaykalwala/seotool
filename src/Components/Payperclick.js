        <p>Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising is a potent technique in the field of digital marketing that can be used to generate leads and drive targeted visitors. Achieving corporate goals and optimizing return on investment (ROI) depend on efficient PPC administration. This manual explores the main facets of pay-per-click (PPC) administration, providing information on tactics, resources, and industry standards. </p>


<b>What is PPC Advertising?</b>
        <p>With pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, marketers pay a fee each time a user clicks on their advertisement. In essence, it's a method of purchasing website visitors rather than making an effort to "earn" them naturally. Although Google Ads is the most widely used platform for PPC advertising, Bing Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads are also good options.

        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
        PPC is an online advertising model where advertisers pay a fee each time their ad is clicked. It's a way of buying visits to your site, rather than attempting to earn those visits organically. PPC ads appear on search engines, social media platforms, and other websites, targeting specific keywords and demographics to attract potential customers.
